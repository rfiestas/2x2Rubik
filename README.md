 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube Solver
```

The 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube (also called as Pocket Cube or Mini Cube) is the two layered version of a Rubik's Cube. This puzzle was invented by Rubik Erno before the 80s and was patented on March 29, 1983. At first sight it may seem to be a simple puzzle but it's good to know that it has more than 3,6 million possible permutations so it's impossible to solve it by just randomly twisting the faces.
